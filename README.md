# RPA Development Effort Estimation
This is an example development effort estimation study for a RPA project that involves automating invoice processing.

## Important Note !
- Note that this is just an example and the actual effort estimation for your project may vary depending on the complexity of the requirements, the experience level of the team, and other factors. It's important to have a thorough understanding of the project requirements and to involve all stakeholders in the effort estimation process to ensure a realistic and accurate estimate.

## Project Details
- Project : Automating invoice processing using UiPath

- Project Description : The goal of this project is to automate the processing of invoices using UiPath. The automation will involve extracting data from invoices, validating the data against certain criteria, and entering the data into an accounting system. The invoices will be in PDF format.

## Effort Estimation Subjects

- Solution design and architecture (REFramework configuration, Technical Analysis, Orch. Queue configuration etc.)
- User Stories
- Unit Tests, Best Practices
- Integration, Functional Tests
- User acceptance testing (UAT), Deploy
- Technical documentation (optional)
- User documentation (optional)
- Code review (optional)

## Tasks and Estimation

The following table shows the tasks involved in the project and their corresponding estimation in days:

| Tasks                                                 | Estimation (Day) | Notes                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Solution design and architecture                      | 1                |                                          |
| Extracting data from invoices (story)                         | 1                |                                          |
| Validating extracted data (story)                             | 1                |                                          |
| Entering data into accounting system (story)                  | 2                |                                          |
| Creating process output report and sending e-mail to process owner (story) | 0.5              |                                          |
| Unit Tests, Best Practices                            | 0.8              | 0.2 * 4 User Story = 0.8                 |
| Integration, Functional Tests                         | 0.5              |                                          |
| Code review                         | 0.5              |                                          |
| User acceptance testing (UAT), Deploy                 | 1                |                                          |
| All + Contingency additional time (%30)                | 10.79            |                                          |
| All                                                   | 8.3              |                                          |

Note: The contingency additional time is estimated to be 30% of the total effort.

## Conclusion

Based on the effort estimation table, the total estimated effort for this UiPath project is approximately 7.8 days without contingency additional time and 10.14 days with contingency additional time.
